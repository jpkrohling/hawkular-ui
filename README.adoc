= Hawkular Console

[.lead]
*Hawkular Console* is the home of the UI console for Hawkular.  The current console is based on https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/blob/master/docs/Overview2dotX.md[Hawt.io 2], which is (now) a javascript based client-side framework.
This console application pulls in various bower packages (libs) and Hawt.io 2 plugins (which are also bower packages) to plug-n-play various functionality to the console. Since one of the bower packages it pulls in is our Hawt.io plugin, it loads this plugin and adds it to the nav bar.
